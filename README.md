# Manifold Roleplaying Framework

Manifold is a **genre-agnostic tabletop roleplaying framework** designed around long-horizon consequence, shared reasoning, and cooperative judgment. It rejects traditional RPG assumptions (stats, classes, DCs, adversarial GMing) in favor of a **state-driven system** where possibility is defined by fiction and persistent state, and dice are used sparingly to sample uncertainty.

This repository contains the canonical manuscripts and design specifications that define Manifold.

## What Manifold Is

* A **shared cognitive system**, not a hidden rules engine
* A game about **consequence, pressure, and change**, not binary success/failure
* A framework that **requires and supports GM judgment** rather than replacing it
* Designed for **cooperative, good-faith play**

Manifold assumes that:

* The world exists independently of the players
* Pressure accumulates whether or not it is addressed
* Characters are shaped by history, not builds
* Dice never grant permission; they only sample uncertainty

## Core Manuscripts (Complete)

These three documents are the primary entry points for using Manifold.

### 📘 Manifold Game Master Manual

The definitive guide for running Manifold.

Covers:

* The role of the GM as curator, not controller
* Play modes and time handling
* Declaring intent and shaping outcome spaces
* Pressure, instability, and consequence
* How and when dice are used

**Start here if you are running the game.**

### 📗 Manifold Player Guide

A concise guide for players.

Covers:

* What players control (and what they don’t)
* Declaring intent
* Character declaration through constraint
* How pressure, instability, and growth feel in play

**Recommended reading for all players before the first session.**

### 📙 Manifold World Building Guide

Guidance for GMs creating a world or campaign using Manifold.

Covers:

* Genre as constraint, not flavor
* World state and pressure design
* Choosing and stress-testing a dice grammar
* Establishing initial world state
* Safely expanding and iterating over time

---

## Design Specifications (Draft / Canonical)

The `/design` materials define Manifold’s internal structure. These are **constitutional and structural documents**, not player-facing rules.

They include:

* Design Assumptions & Play Ethos
* Conceptual Resolution & Dice Contract
* Growth–Regression Contract
* Capability & Coherence Framework
* Instability & Pressure Specification
* Interference Resolution Specification
* Time & Play Modes Specification
* Initial State Specification
* Tag, Track, and Notation Specifications
* Dice Grammar Interface & Guidelines
* Itemization & Gear Framework

These documents exist to:

* Preserve design invariants
* Enable consistent implementations
* Support future genre adaptations

They are not required reading to play, but **are authoritative** for authors and implementers.

---

## What Manifold Is Not

Manifold is deliberately **not**:

* A stat-based or class-based system
* A tactical combat engine
* A balance-focused or optimization-driven game
* A GM-vs-players experience
* A rules-complete engine that eliminates judgment

If you are looking for tight procedural resolution, build optimization, or adversarial challenge structures, Manifold is likely not a good fit.

---

## Repository Status

* Core manuscripts: **Complete**
* Design specifications: **Active / Draft, some Canonical**
* Public playtesting: Ongoing

This repository represents a **living framework**, not a finished product line.

---

## License & Use

Manifold is intended to be:

* Played
* Adapted
* Extended into genre-specific implementations

Please respect the design invariants when building on the framework. Extensions should be implemented *within* Manifold’s structure rather than altering its core assumptions.

## Getting Started

1. Read the **Player Guide**
2. Read the **Game Master Manual**
3. If running a campaign, read the **World Building Guide**
4. Play. Learn through use. Adjust through judgment.

Manifold is learned at the table, not by mastering a ruleset.
