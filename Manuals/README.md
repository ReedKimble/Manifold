# Manifold Manuals

This folder contains the **complete, player-facing manuscripts** for the Manifold Roleplaying Framework.

These PDFs are the authoritative texts for learning, running, and playing Manifold. They are written to be read directly and do not require reference to the underlying design specifications.

### **Manifold Player Guide**

A concise introduction for players.

Guidance for GMs creating a campaign or setting.

## Notes

* These manuals assume **cooperative, good-faith play**.
* Manifold relies on **GM judgment**, supported by structure rather than replaced by rules.
* Dice are used sparingly to sample uncertainty, not to grant permission or determine success.

For system architecture, invariants, and implementation guidance, see the design documents in the root of the repository.
